# TSF---Prediction-using-Unsupervised-ML
   1. To predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.


## The following steps have been taken to complete this project.

### 1. Importing various librarires.
   ### A. Pandas to read the csv file
   ### B. Numpy, seaborne, matplotlib for EDA
   ### C. KMeans for clustering.
   
### 2. Data display, Data Describe, Checking for any null values.

### 3. Explorartory Data Analysis - Visualization of the DF using various graps & plots.

### 6. Finding Optimum Number of Clusters. Optimum means most conducive to a favourable outcome; best.

### 7. Applying kmeans to the dataset / Creating the kmeans classifie

### 8. Visualization the clusters - - On the first two columns (sepal length and sepal width)
